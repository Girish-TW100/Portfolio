# Technical Writing Portfolio: API & Developer Documentation
## Girish Malagimani | Senior Technical Writer (Bangalore, India)

Welcome! This repository serves as a showcase of my transition from traditional technical writing to **API and Developer Experience (DX)** documentation. 

As a Senior Technical Writer with experience in complex enterprise SaaS environments, I specialize in deconstructing intricate system architectures into clear, actionable, and code-centric documentation.

## 📖 My Documentation Philosophy
I believe that documentation is a core product feature. In a high-growth environment, my focus is on:
1. **Self-Sufficiency:** Using the product and reading code to reduce dependency on SMEs.
2. **Scannability:** Designing for developers who skip the prose and look for the code blocks.
3. **Accuracy:** Testing every code snippet to ensure a seamless "Getting Started" experience.
